## Brainstorm


The process of designing and planning an app is a process of narrowing in on a specific problem that an app can solve for a specific group of people. This design process involves brainstorming a number of different ideas, then focusing on one of those ideas and following an iterative pattern of planning, prototyping, and conducting user interviews to come up with a concrete design for your app.

In the brainstorming stage, you identify problems and come up with possible solutions.
Read the five key topics below for ideas and prompts that you can use to brainstorm. **Any tasks marked with a ✏️ record into a new document to submit.**  Some of the topics have multiple ideas that you can tackle as you dive deeper into the design cycle. Use a journaling app or Notes to document the brainstorming process

### Purpose

Think about the apps that you use:
* ✏️ Identify each app’s purpose and why you use it.  
* ✏️ Which apps do you use most, and which apps did you stop using after just a few times? 
* ✏️ Why did you download it in the first place?
* ✏️ Brainstorm a list of criteria that make an app good.

### Ideas

* ✏️ Brainstorm a list of apps you’d like to build. These could be new ideas, apps you think you can improve or personalize, or something silly. Browse the App Store for inspiration. Keep adding to this list and revisit it, as some ideas might become more or less interesting or crazy in the future.

#### Deeper Dive
Do a little research on your initial top ideas (at least 3 apps). Take ​​a good look at the App Store.  

Do your app ideas already exist? Don’t be discouraged if you find one or several that are like the app you’ve imagined. It just means you had ​a good idea. And maybe now that you’ve seen a bunch of similar apps, you can see ways of improving them.

*  ✏️ For each of your app ideas, identify the top three competitors on the App Store. 
If you can, download the apps to check them out. Pay attention to how easy they are to use. If you can't download the app, look at the screenshots or google around for a demo of the app on YouTube.
*  ✏️ Can you suggest any improvements to the user interface?
*  ✏️ How could ​​they be designed better?

* ✏️ If there are any user reviews on the App Store, be sure to read those carefully, too. What are people finding difficult about the apps?  What else ​do they wish the apps could do? Where are people getting confused? How would your app address each of these concerns?”

### Audience 

Whom do you want to use your app? It’s important ​​to design with a target audience in mind. Explore apps from different categories in the App Store. Take a look at the icons, screenshots, and descriptions. 

*  ✏️What have you learned about the audience those apps are meant for?
* ✏️ Did the developers do a good job communicating that? 
* ✏️ Judging from the screenshots or preview video, do you think the apps are appropriate for their intended audiences?


#### Deeper Dive
 * ✏️ Pick a few of your app ideas and create a persona for each type of person who would use that app. 

Here are a few questions you should answer about these personas:
*  ✏️ What does this person do? 
* ✏️ How old is she? 
* ✏️ Why is she using the app? 
* ✏️ Does she prefer pictures or words?
* ✏️ How often does she use her device?

> Here are two examples of personas:
1. Anna, 15 years old. Anna is a sophomore who’s new to school. She loves to draw. Anna likes to look at maps so she can get a visual sense of where she is and can then wander around without getting lost. Anna loves apps that are simple and easy to use, because she doesn’t want to spend her day with her face in her phone. She’s afraid she’ll miss seeing all the beautiful things in the world.

2. Mrs. Wilson, 38 years old. Mrs. Wilson is an English teacher with a large number of students in her classes. She’d like to be able to project apps on the big screen so everyone can see them. She’s frustrated by apps with lots of details, because students in the back of the room can’t see things clearly. Her school’s connection is very slow, which prevents her from showing apps that require Internet access.

Once you’ve written a few profiles, go back to your prototype sketches. 
* ✏️ How might you improve them?

### Focus
Review your list of app ideas. 
* ✏️ Which ones seem most interesting? Focus on a few ideas for further brainstorming. ✏️ What purposes do they serve, and how do they solve issues? 
* ✏️ Who are the audiences?

#### Deeper Dive

Write app statements to clearly define the purpose of the app. This can help you to decide whether it’s a good idea or not. 

* ✏️ App Statement:
My app will:___________ (What will your app do?)
because:______________ (Why does this need exist?)
My app will tell a new student exactly where to be right now and how to get there, because new students often get lost.


### Reiterate
As you repeat the design cycle, think about what you learned from your evaluation.

* ✏️ Did any problems come up, and how can you fix them?
* ✏️ How can you improve your app?
**Another important question to ask yourself is whether you’re still excited about your app idea. If not, it might be time to go back to your list.** Not all ideas pan out. One objective of the design cycle is to help you test concepts and figure out what’s worth pursuing.

#### Deeper Dive
Revisit your great app criteria from the “Purpose” topic. 
* ✏️ Is your ​app innovative?
* ✏️ Does it do something that other existing apps don’t do? 
* ✏️ Does your initial prototype seem like it would give a ​good first impression? Is it an app someone would use over and over again?
